report on the Tiny Reduced Instruction Set Computer(TRISC) built by us as a part of the CSE2441 Digital Logic Term Project

    This is a ABET project, which includes successful learning and application of block diagrams and verilog programming to create a 
    Tiny Reduced Instruction Set Computer (TRISC). By the completion of this project, I learned a lot about FPGAs, 
    Digital Logic components and Verilog Programming. Also, this was possible by the incessant assistance from Dr. Bill D Carroll, UT Arlington.
